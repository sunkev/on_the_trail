#### Product Backlog

https://trello.com/b/cLhb0bj9/product-backlog

The product backlog items were ordered based on MVP (minimum viable product). We wanted to start with the most basic functionalities, putting an emphasis on difficulty and impact due to our limited amount of development time.

#### Estimating

We estimated our product backlog items using "Planning Poker", albeit a somewhat modified version. We did not use cards, but individually wrote down our estimates on a piece of paper, and revealed them to eachother at the same time. Because of the size of our team, our Scrum Master and Product Owner are having to play dual roles and are also part of the Development Team. During our estimating activity, everyone acted as a member of the Development Team and participated.

#### Planning Our First Sprint

We have forecasted our velocity to be 20 story points per one week sprint. We agreed that it was resonable to expect each Development Team member to complete 5 story points per sprint, which sums up to the 20 points we have forecasted for the entire team. Accordingly we have pulled 7 stories into our Sprint Backlog which totals up to 20 story points.
